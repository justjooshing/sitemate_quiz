Introduction

Your challenge is to create a simple REST API Server + Client for Issues (think GitHub or Jira Issues) within 2 hours.

Issues can be hard-coded JSON objects with just 3 attributes: id, title + description.

The client + server should accept or send these hardcoded JSON objects according to each API call: Create, Read, Update & Delete.

REST API Server

The REST API server can be anything that can return static JSON - local on your machine or in the cloud. For example: local Node.js, Python or any server running on your machine, a serverless function in the cloud, a container, whatever youâ€™re most comfortable with.

The server should support these 4 standard operations:
Create: accepts a JSON object & prints/logs the object
Read: returns a static JSON object
Update: accepts a JSON object & prints/logs the object
Delete: prints/logs out the object or id to delete

REST API Client

The REST API Client can be a command line interface (CLI) or a web app that connects to each of the server endpoints and prints out the response. Ideally, this is a Node.js or a React client, but could be anything that connects to your server.

The client should support the same 4 standard operations:
Create: sends a JSON object to the server
Read: requests a JSON object & prints it out
Update: sends a JSON object to the server
Delete: requests the server delete an issue

Requirements

1. Your client and server should communicate together.

2. The API should be designed to be extensible.

3. Create a git repo in either Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket etc. Commit & push as you would for normally, we expect to see at least a few separate commits. Please share the url in the submission page

4. Please use Loom to record a short, 2 minutes high-level walkthrough for your solution covering the following points:
   Your technology choices
   Your API design
   Demonstrate each operation
   Any improvements you would like to make
   Bonus point

If you finish within the time limit, feel free to address one or more of these items:
Send different issues objects depending on each API read request.
Add unit tests
Introduce a data store
Create an interactive client
Use docker to wrap the application
